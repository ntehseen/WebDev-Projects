                        Born in Smiljan, Austria (now Croatia) in 1856, Nikola Tesla embarked on his journey in
                        electrical engineering. After studying in Graz, he moved to the United States, where he would
                        make groundbreaking contributions to alternating current (AC) technology, including the
                        development of the induction motor and transformer.

                    <br>
                    <dd>The 1890s marked a period of innovation for Tesla. He demonstrated wireless electricity at the
                        1893 World's Columbian Exposition and initiated the ambitious Wardenclyffe Tower project. In
                        Colorado Springs, he conducted groundbreaking experiments that expanded our understanding of
                        electricity.</dd>

                        Tesla found himself in a fierce rivalry with Marconi over radio technology during this time.
                        Despite his pioneering work, he faced financial difficulties, ultimately leading to bankruptcy
                        and the loss of many patents.
